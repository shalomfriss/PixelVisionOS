  This project was designed to display some basic instructions when you create
  a new game.  Simply delete the following code and implement your own Init(),
  Update() and Draw() logic.

-- Loads in the pico-8 APIs
LoadScript("pico-8-shim")

-- TODO load a Pico8 Lua. Once loaded, Init, Update and Draw will call the p8 script's functions.

-- This this is an empty game, we will the following text. We combined two sets of fonts into
-- the default.font.png. Use uppercase for larger characters and lowercase for a smaller one.
local message = "EMPTY GAME\n\n\nThis is an empty game template. Press Esc to exit the game. \n\n\nVisit 'pixelvision8.com' to learn more about creating games from scratch."

-- The Init() method is part of the game's lifecycle and called a game starts. We are going to
-- use this method to configure background color, ScreenBufferChip and draw a text box.
function Init()

  -- Test to see if a Pico8 _init function exists and call that.
  if(_init ~= nil) then
    _init()

    -- If no Pico8 Init exits, run the empty template code
  else

    -- Here we are manually changing the background color
    BackgroundColor(8)

    local display = Display()

    -- We are going to render the message in a box as tiles. To do this, we need to wrap the
    -- text, then split it into lines and draw each line.
    local wrap = WordWrap(message:lower(), ((display.x / 8) * 2) - 2)
    local lines = SplitLines(wrap)
    local total = #lines
    local startY = display.y - (total * 8)

    -- We want to render the text from the bottom of the screen so we offset it and loop backwards.
    for i = total, 1, - 1 do
      DrawText(lines[i], 4, startY + ((i - 1) * 8), DrawMode.TilemapCache, "default", 7, - 4)
    end
  end

end

-- The Update() method is part of the game's life cycle. The engine calls Update() on every frame
-- before the Draw() method. It accepts one argument, timeDelta, which is the difference in
-- milliseconds since the last frame.
function Update(timeDelta)

  -- Test to see if a Pico8 _update function exists and call it on each update
  if(_update ~= nil) then
    _update()
  end

end

-- The Draw() method is part of the game's life cycle. It is called after Update() and is where
-- all of our draw calls should go. We'll be using this to render sprites to the display.
function Draw()

  -- Test to see if a Pico8 _draw function exits and call it on each draw
  if(_draw ~= nil) then
    _draw()
  else
    -- We can use the RedrawDisplay() method to clear the screen and redraw the tilemap in a
    -- single call.
    RedrawDisplay()
  end
